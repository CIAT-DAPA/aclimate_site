"Aclímate Colombia, nueva luz para los agricultores colombianos","CIAT trained agro-climatology teams from the National Federation of Rice Growers and the National Federation of Cereal and Legume Growers in the use of the 'Aclimate Colombia Forecasts' platform. The platform is part of the USAID-funded 'Climate Services for Resilient Development-Colombia' project and provides accurate and timely climate information to agricultural associations to help them make better planting decisions and prepare for climatic variations. The platform allows knowing future weather conditions based on historical information and is related to crop simulation models to provide more relevant information to producers. CIAT will work closely with producer organizations to address their priorities.",8/16/2017,https://alliancebioversityciat.org/stories/aclimate-colombia-nueva-luz-para-los-agricultores-colombianos,"https://alliancebioversityciat.org/sites/default/files/styles/1920_scale/public/images/modelacion.jpg?itok=3oTjTus8"
"Aclímate Colombia (Acclimatize Colombia), a new light for Colombian farmers","CIAT (International Center for Tropical Agriculture) trained the teams of agro-climatology and systems from the National Federation of Rice Growers (Fedearroz) and the National Federation of Cereal and Legume Growers (Fenalce) in the use of the platform 'Pronósticos Aclimate Colombia'. This platform is part of the 'Climate Services for Resilient Development - Colombia' project funded by USAID, aimed at improving forecasting methods and tools for farmers to make better decisions about planting crops. The platform provides reliable climate information to the associations and enables access to agro-climate information, making it easier to analyze and interpret meteorological data and configure climate forecasting models. It also helps predict future temperature and rainfall conditions and connect climate predictions with crop simulation models, providing more contextualized information to farmers. CIAT's role is to work closely with producer organizations to understand their priorities and provide the necessary information. The platform aims to make the Colombian agricultural sector better prepared to confront climate variations.",8/22/2017,"https://alliancebioversityciat.org/stories/aclimate-colombia-acclimatize-colombia-new-light-colombian-farmers","https://alliancebioversityciat.org/sites/default/files/styles/1920_scale/public/images/modelacion.jpg?itok=3oTjTus8"
"Melisa chatbot, el 'oráculo' de los agricultores colombianos","The Bioversity International Alliance and CIAT have launched 'Melisa chatbot', an artificial intelligence system that provides agro-climatic forecasts available on Whatsapp, Facebook and Telegram. The forecast platform, called 'Aclimate Colombia', is accessible through the Melisa chatbot and allows farmers and peasants to consult forecasts on rainfall and the potential yield of rice and corn crops according to weather conditions and the date on which they were sow the crop, the variety of seed used, among other factors. The platform works like any other contact on social networks and it is possible to ask questions in the chat and get answers about weather forecasts and crop yields. Currently, the departments available for consultation include Casanare, Córdoba, Tolima, Valle del Cauca, and Huila.",8/5/2022,"https://www.agronet.gov.co/Noticias/Paginas/Melisa-chatbot,-el-%E2%80%98or%C3%A1culo%E2%80%99-de-los-agricultores-colombianos.aspx","https://www.agronet.gov.co/Noticias/PublishingImages/Melisa%20infografia-01%20(1).jpg"
"MELISA CHATBOT","Melisa chatbot is an AI system available on WhatsApp, Facebook and Telegram that provides agroclimatic and yield forecasts for rice and maize crops in Colombia. It uses climate forecasts from the Aclimate Colombia service and communicates with users in non-technical language to support their decision making. It is currently available in 9 departments and can be accessed by adding Melisa as a contact on WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger or Telegram. The tool is useful for farmers and rural communities who need to understand weather and climate forecasts and how they impact their crop production. The aim is to eventually make it accessible on other platforms like SMS for low quality internet areas. Results will be updated as they emerge.",8/5/2022,https://alliancebioversityciat.org/tools-innovations/melisa-chatbot,"https://alliancebioversityciat.org/sites/default/files/styles/1920_scale/public/images/Melisa%20chatbot.png?itok=pY1ly2ag"
Melisa chatbot - the 'oracle' for Colombian farmers,"Melisa Chatbot is an artificial intelligence system that provides agro-climatic forecasts, developed by the Alliance of Bioversity International and the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT). It is accessible through WhatsApp, Facebook and Telegram and provides information on weather forecasts, rice and corn crop yields based on sowing dates and seed variety. The platform uses the Aclimate Colombia service and is able to interpret user's information needs and provide accurate answers. The service is currently available in several Colombian departments and the plan is to make it available in areas with poor internet coverage in the future. The project is supported by several partners and is led by scientist Julián Ramírez.",7/22/2022,https://alliancebioversityciat.org/stories/melisa-chatbot-el-oraculo-de-los-agricultores-colombianos,"https://alliancebioversityciat.org/sites/default/files/styles/1920_scale/public/images/Melisa%20chatbot.png?itok=pY1ly2ag"
